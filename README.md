# He Said She Said Confirming Biases Between Single Men and Women in the Philippines

There are many biases revolving around gender. While the physical differences between the genders are more obvious, there are other alleged differences between the gender which sometimes border on myths and sexism. Using the FIES study of the Philippines, our group wanted to shed further light on these supposed differences and help dispel or support these beliefs. By helping to delineate the differences and non-differences between the genders, our study hopes to create more connections between the genders. We can show through this study that while we are different in many ways, there are also many ways that we are the same. Hopefully, we can embrace these similarities and differences.
